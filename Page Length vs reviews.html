            <h2>
              In this Graph we wanted to see if there was a possible relationship between the number of pages and the average score a book received on Goodreads. The reason we wanted to explore this was because understanding the number of pages that had the optimal score would be useful to book publishers when looking at page count. 
            </h2>
            <h2>
                Note: most publishers look at word count as a metric, but because that metric was not easily available, we simply settled on page count. 
            </h2>
            <h2>
                The biggest challenge with this chart was cleaning the data. Ultimately, we had to get rid of books that were above 1,500 pages and less than 30. To many of these points were not actual books and simply skewed the data. There were also several books that simply did not receive enough reviews, so we had to limit our number of written reviews by 100. 
            </h2>
            <h2>
                In conclusion from the data we could not find a clear relationship between the number of pages and Good Reads score. We can see that the bulk of books exist in the 200 to 400-page range. That would be expected and is likely what most publishers expect the length of a book to be at. However, there is no evidence to support that the length of a book would contribute to a better good reads rating.
